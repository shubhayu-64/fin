RNN_LSTM_GRU
- used to predict the price of stock [Adj Close] for next 2 days using information of past 5 days 
- Working [OK]

Regression Models
- Used different methords to predict the stock price of nth day in future by just using value of stock present day 
(x, y), x - price of stock present day, y - price of stock of nth day in future
- Out of all the model Multi_Layer_Perceptron and Linear Regression models performed best so we are going to fine tune 
them to get better R^2 value, R^2 score explaines the percentage of variance that can be explained by predictor 
variables
- Working [OK]

ARIMA
- Used to predict the stock price overtime used statistical methords, like ARMA(p, q) & ARIMA(p, d, q) and then fine
tuning it, to predict the stock price.
- ARMA [Auto Regressior Moving Average]
- ARMA(1, 1)
price_i = beta_0 + beta_1 . price_{i - 1} + phi_1 . error_{i - 1} + error_i
predicted_price_i = beta_0 + beta_1 . price_{i - 1} + phi_1 . error_{i - 1}
error_i = price_i - predicted_price_i
- Auto Regressior part - (beta_0 + beta_1 . price_{i - 1}), based on previous p terms
- Moving Average part - (phi_1 . error_{i - 1}), based on previous q terms
- PACF helps to find p, ACF helps to find q
